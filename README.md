# Lofi - Upgraded

This is the official lofi website repository that will be used for now. All commits to the main website will be pushed here. The main /lofi repository has been scratched and is under "reconstruction" to a more fluid, aesthetic-looking design that will be released here. After the website is complete, everything will be transferred to the /lofi repository.

**Current Features:**
 - Floating audio player with the other main contents of the website having a more aesthetic, clean-looking design
 - Integrated Google Authentication with Firebase and Cloud Firestore
 - Users can sign in with their Google Account and they have a profile they can customize to their desire
 - There is a side menu now to integrate other features that cannot be fit on one page on the home screen
 - If the user joins and is new, it redirects to a sign-in page as you cannot access the main website without signing in.

**Future Plans:**
 - Find a way to customize your profile even more (Profile Picture, Banner Image, Profile Panel Background, Profile Effects, Badges)
 - Add friending and a chat feature
 - Add an option for the user to select their music genre
 - Add minigames to play when bored
 - Add focus mode for users who want to study
 - Add ambient sounds
 - Add a pane that allows customization for the whole website based on the user's preferences
 - Add an about me page and a contact us page
 - Add a settings pane for the whole website that includes Google Account settings for the site
 - Add notifications to the website for example when the user gets a new friend request
 - Improve the To-Do List panel and add more features - Make sure to allow customization for the alarm sound
 - Add a calendar to list important dates
 - Add a repeat feature to the audio player to listen to songs on repeat
 - Add announcements/update banners
 - Include a community feature
 - Start a Discord Server for this website

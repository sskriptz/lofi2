# Lofi - Upgraded

This is the official lofi website repository that will be used for now. All commits to the main website will be pushed here. The main /lofi repository has been scratched and is under "reconstruction" to a much more fluid, aesthetic looking design that will be released here. After the website will be fully complete, everything will be transfered to the /lofi repository.

**Current Features:**
 - Floating audio player with the other main contents of the website having a more aesthetic, clean looking design
 - Integrated Google Authentication with Firebase and Cloud Firestore
 - Users can sign in with their Google Account and they have their own profile they can customize to their desire
 - There is a side menu now to integrate other features that cannot be fit in one page on the home screen
 - If the user joins and is new, it redirects to a sign in page as you cannot access the main website without signing in.

**Future Plans:**
 - Find a way to customize profile even more (Profile Picture, Banner Image, Profile Panel Background, Profile Effects)
 - Add friending and a chat feature
 - Add an option for the user to select their music genre
 - Add minigames to play when bored
 - Add focus mode for users who want to study
 - Add ambient sounds
 - Add a pane that allows customization for the whole website based on the user's preferences
 - Add an about me page and a contact us page
 - Add settings pane for the whole website that includes Google Account settings for the site
